        "answer": [
            "At first, we need to declare a state to store our search field value, we will use onChange method so that we can store the search value on every single letter type. After that we will run a filter function on the products array. We will have every single product in the loop. Then we will take only that product who has product.name.toLowercase().includes(search field value from the state and we will also convert the value to lower case) . We will keep those filtered products in a variable. Then we can call a map function and show the products in the UI. That's it!"

            "The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages."
